# Step-1-project
This project was built as its meant for a simple games studio called Playgendary with a few developers and fans.
Since the fans shall be updated by the latest updates on the games that being develop by the team and any features that may be on the games.

Since the project contains only front-end languages I decide to not make the project big  and not small as well; so I start by create 3 which are main page(index), about, and articles which contains the posts of the developers. No fancy CSS applied but I did my best to make the website looks good and cool for the readers and viewers.

No files has been ignored since its a small project.
